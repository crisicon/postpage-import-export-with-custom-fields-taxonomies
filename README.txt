This plugin adds Export and Import buttons for posts/pages, enabling JSON exports of post details and simplifying content addition.

== Description ==

This plugin streamlines content management across different versions of a WordPress site by enabling the export and import of post/page content in JSON format.
It eliminates the need for manual copying by allowing you to download post details—including content, title, categories, and featured image—into a JSON file.
This file can then be uploaded to another post, automatically updating its content, custom fields, taxonomies, and featured image. The plugin supports:

1. Post Title
2. Post Content
3. Featured Image
4. Taxonomies: Tag, Category, and Custom Taxonomy
5. PostMeta / Custom Fields
Designed to work with major page builders and ACF fields, the plugin offers flexibility to selectively duplicate posts, avoiding the need for full database migration.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin folder to the /wp-content/plugins/ directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in the WordPress Dashboard.
